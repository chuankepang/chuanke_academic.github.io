# ðŸ‘‹ About Me

I am a Ph.D. student in the [LEVIR lab.](http://levir.buaa.edu.cn/) at [Beihang University](https://www.buaa.edu.cn/), advised by Prof. [Zhenwei Shi](http://levir.buaa.edu.cn/) and Prof. [Zhengxia Zou](https://zhengxiazou.github.io/). Before that, I received my B.S. and M.S. degree in [Image Processing Center](http://www.sa.buaa.edu.cn/) at [Beihang University](https://www.buaa.edu.cn/).

Having graduated from <a href="http://hit.edu.cn/">Harbin Institute of Technology (HIT)</a>, I'm currently pursuing my postgraduate studies at <a href="http://buaa.edu.cn/">Beihang University (BUAA)</a>, where I enjoy integrating intelligent control algorithms to make robots smarter. My research focuses on robot learning â€“ to enable machines to intelligently interact with the world, improve themselves over time and acquire novel skills via machine learning. 
My research interests lie in the deep learning, computer vision, remote sensing image processing, and multimodal.
